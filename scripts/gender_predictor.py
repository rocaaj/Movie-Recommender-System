Project: Gender Prediction for Movie Database

Description:
    This script predicts the gender of actors using the Gender Guesser library. It extracts first names of actors from
    the SQLite database, predicts their gender, and stores these predictions in the database. Additionally,
    it evaluates the accuracy of these predictions.

Acknowledgments:
    This project was developed collaboratively by Dario Santiago Lopez, Anthony Roca, and ChatGPT 4o with Canvas.
    Special thanks to ChatGPT for assistance in developing and refining the prediction logic.
